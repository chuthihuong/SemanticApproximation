# Semantic Approximation for Reducing Code Bloat in Genetic Programming
This code provides a Java implementation of Semantic Approximation as described in "Semantic Approximation for Reducing Code Bloat in Genetic Programming" by Thi Huong Chu et al.
# Method
    GP/GP: Standard GP,
    GP/TS-R: Statistics tournament selection with random,
    GP/TS-S: Statistics test tournament selection with size,
    GP/TS-P: Statistics tournament selection with probability,l
    GP/RDO: Crossover- random desired operator (RDO),
    GP/TS-RDO:The method which combines TS-S with RDO.
    GP/SiS: Semantic in Selection (SiS)
    GP/TS-S-Limit: Statistics tournament selection with size and limited number of fitcase.
